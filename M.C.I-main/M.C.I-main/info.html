            Basic info on Morse Code:
            <br>
            Morse code is a method used in telecommunication to encode text characters<br>
 as standardized sequences of two different signal durations, called dots <br>
and dashes, or dits and dahs. Morse code is named after Samuel Morse,<br>
 one of the inventors of the telegraph.<br>
 

            <br>
            USES OF MORSE CODE
<br>
Emergency communication: Morse code is an efficient way to communicate about <br>
emergency situations since you can send such messages via ham radio transmitters<br>
 with little power and less bandwidth than other standard voice communication tools.<br>
 In addition, because these messages are only intelligible to people who are fluent <br>
in the code, it serves as a helpful tool for confidential communications.<br>
<br>


<br>
Intellectual enrichment: While Morse code doesn't have as many applications as it<br>
 once did in the professional sphere, <br>
learning it can offer you a significant amount of enrichment intellectually. <br>
Challenging yourself to learn the code can allow you to engage in a mental activity <br>
that may strengthen your capacity to learn other useful skills.<br>
<br>
In our website we use different visual colors and various audio to educate <br>
our users with the Morse Code and a Simple way on learning the Code.
<br>

<br>
To educate children who are specially abled, we will engage different methods<br>
like Visual method (By the use of White and black screens) and Audible method <br>
(By the use of sound).<br>

<br>

Children who are visually challanged can access the Audible  mode of learning and <br>
the children who are deaf can access the visual mode of learning.
