                               IMPORTANT!!
HEYYA There, this note is brief introduction on how to use this program
going forth.
    
Basic info on Morse COde:
Morse code is a method used in telecommunication to encode text characters
 as standardized sequences of two different signal durations, called dots 
and dashes, or dits and dahs. Morse code is named after Samuel Morse,
 one of the inventors of the telegraph.

                         USES OF MORSE CODE
Emergency communication: Morse code is an efficient way to communicate about 
emergency situations since you can send such messages via ham radio transmitters
 with little power and less bandwidth than other standard voice communication tools.
 In addition, because these messages are only intelligible to people who are fluent 
in the code, it serves as a helpful tool for confidential communications.


Intellectual enrichment: While Morse code doesn't have as many applications as it
 once did in the professional sphere, 
learning it can offer you a significant amount of enrichment intellectually. 
Challenging yourself to learn the code can allow you to engage in a mental activity 
that may strengthen your capacity to learn other useful skills.


In our website we use different visual colors and various audio to educate 
our users with the Morse Code and a Simple way on learning the Code.

To educate children who are specially abled, we will engage different methods
like Visual method (By the use of White and black screens) and Audible method 
(By the use of sound).

Children who are visually challanged can access the Audible  mode of learning and 
the children who are deaf can access the visual mode of learning.
